[ssh_connection]

# Find information about ssh plugin options here:
# https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/ssh_connection.html

# (boolean) This is a global option, each connection plugin can override either by having more specific options or not supporting pipelining at all.
# Pipelining, if supported by the connection plugin, reduces the number of network operations required to execute a module on the remote server, by executing many Ansible modules without actual file transfer.
# It can result in a very significant performance improvement when enabled.
# However this conflicts with privilege escalation (become). For example, when using 'sudo:' operations you must first disable 'requiretty' in /etc/sudoers on all managed hosts, which is why it is disabled by default.
# This setting will be disabled if ``ANSIBLE_KEEP_REMOTE_FILES`` is enabled.
pipelining=True

# Deprecated in version 2.17 in favor of `ssh_transfer_method`
# (boolean) Preferred method to use when transferring files over SSH.
# When set to smart, Ansible will try them until one succeeds or they all fail.
# If set to True, it will force ‘scp’, if False it will use ‘sftp’.
scp_if_ssh=True

# (string) Arguments to pass to all SSH CLI tools.
ssh_args = -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=60s -o PreferredAuthentications=publickey
